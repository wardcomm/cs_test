Encoding a URL

Objective
Your assignment is to implement a URL shortening service using Python.
Brief
Encoding a URL such as http://anywebsite.com/app/docs and returns an encoded URL such as http://someapp/GeAi9K.
Tasks
•	Implement assignment using:
•	Language: Python
•	Two endpoints are required
•	/encode - Encodes a URL to a shortened URL
•	/decode - Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
•	Both endpoints should return JSON
•	There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to make sure that a URL can be encoded to a short URL and the short URL can be decoded to the original URL. You do not need to persist short URLs to a database. Keep them in memory.
•	Assemble your app into a github repo in a sensible way -- include a Readme that is pretty & explains how to operate, install, and run the app.
•	Provide API tests for both endpoints
•	bonus: rate limit the service to 2 requests per second
Evaluation Criteria
•	Python best practices
•	API implemented featuring a /encode and /decode endpoint
•	Show us your work through your commit history
•	Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
•	Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
•	Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
Submission
Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the main branch. After you have pushed your code, please submit your github link to recruiting.
All the best,
